# Configuration
Once you have docker installed:
 - Clone the repository
 - Edit the config.txt file to include:
    - your bot token
    - owner ID
    - any other changes you want to make
- Then run
    `docker build . -t <whatever>`
- The container can then be run with:
    `docker run <whatever>`
